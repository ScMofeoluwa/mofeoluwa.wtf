        <p>
            I am Mofeoluwa Lijadu, a backend developer by profession,
            proficient in Python and TypeScript. Although my skill set is diverse, these days, I find
            myself primarily engrossed in TypeScript. Additionally, I relish my leisure time as a meme
            connoisseur by choice.
