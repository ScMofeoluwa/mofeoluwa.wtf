## Pre

So earlier this year, I read an article and it was titled "Create more, consume less". And considering that fact that I actually have consumed more this year [an example is that I've read more articles this year since the time I was born]. So I decided that I was going to start creating nevertheless, writing codes more than reading tech based articles and writing down my musings.

## Intra

Few days ago, I picked up one of my favorite animes after about 3 months [Jojo's Adventure] and in a particular episode a character made a statement "The more curious a person is, the stronger they become mentally" and I guess I'd just write on that.

A strong desire precedes a strong mental personality and this is true. With a strong desire, we learn not to compromise and live with our current situation but rather evolve. We take daring steps out of curiosity and we don't even care if we fail or not but we just want to enjoy the process.
The same way there's ROI (return on investment), there's such thing as ROF (return on failure) which might have stemmed out of curiosity. And what is this return? It's success in the long run and a shapening of mentality. This is more or less a call to be more daring and curious. Lezzgediz
